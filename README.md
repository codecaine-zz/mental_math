# Mental Math Cheat Sheet

A compact, practice-ready set of mental math shortcuts, examples, and mnemonics. Designed for fast recall and 5-second drills.

- Main sheet: see `mental_math.md`
- Audience: students, interview prep, speed arithmetic fans, and anyone who wants faster everyday math.

## What’s inside

- Addition & subtraction shortcuts (round-and-fix, complements)
- Multiplication patterns (×9/11/25/75/125, near-base tricks, cross-add)
- Division, percentages & conversions (÷5/9/12, quick % chunks, °F/°C)
- Squares & cubes (ending-in-5 squares, difference of squares, near-100², quick cubes)
- Roots & estimates (linear approximations for √ and ∛, near-10000 √)
- Bonus mini-tricks and a step-by-step practice plan

Open `mental_math.md` for the full, formatted tables and examples.

## Quick start

1) Open `mental_math.md` and pick ONE shortcut.
2) Create a mini-set (8–10 problems) matching that rule.
3) Solve only with that shortcut; aim for ≤5s per problem after warm-up.
4) Check answers quickly. Add a second shortcut once comfortable.

Tip: Use a timer (phone/desktop) and track your average time per set.

## Printing / formatting

- The sheet is optimized for plain-text editors where tables still align.
- For print: export to PDF from your editor/markdown viewer. Use a monospace font for best table alignment.
- If your viewer collapses pipes (|), try enabling code/monospace rendering or export to PDF.

## Contributing

Contributions welcome! Ideas that help:

- Clearer examples or mnemonics
- Additional quick methods with rationale
- Small correctness fixes or formatting improvements

Workflow:

- Edit `mental_math.md` (keep tone, keep tables compact)
- Keep examples correct and mentally computable without a calculator
- Avoid inline HTML (e.g., `&lt;br&gt;`) inside tables; use separators instead (e.g., •)
