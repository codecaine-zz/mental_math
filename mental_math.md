### ‚≠ê Multiplying by 10

**The easiest trick ever:** Just add a zero to the end!

**Why this works:** When you multiply by 10, everything gets 10 times bigger. Adding a zero does exactly that!

**Examples:**

- 47 √ó 10 = **470** (just stick a 0 on the end)
- 125 √ó 10 = **1250** (just stick a 0 on the end)
- 8 √ó 10 = **80** (just stick a 0 on the end)
- 3 √ó 10 = **30** (just stick a 0 on the end)

**üí™ Try these yourself:**
- 56 √ó 10 = ? *(Answer: 560)*
- 14 √ó 10 = ? *(Answer: 140)*
- 200 √ó 10 = ? *(Answer: 2000)*

**Real-life use:** Calculating prices when buying 10 of something!

### ‚≠ê Finding 10% of Any Number

**Super simple:** Move the decimal point one place to the left (or just cross off the last digit and put a decimal).

**Step-by-step:**
1. Look at your number (example: 250)
2. Imagine there's a decimal at the end: 250.
3. Move it one space left: 25.0
4. That's your answer: 25

**Examples:**

- 10% of 250 ‚Üí **25.0** (move the dot left one space)
- 10% of 84 ‚Üí **8.4** (move the dot left one space)
- 10% of 1000 ‚Üí **100.0** (move the dot left one space)
- 10% of 30 ‚Üí **3.0** (move the dot left one space)

**Think of it this way:** Just make the number 10 times smaller!

**üí™ Try these yourself:**
- 10% of 150 = ? *(Answer: 15)*
- 10% of 60 = ? *(Answer: 6)*
- 10% of 500 = ? *(Answer: 50)*

**Why this matters:** Once you can find 10%, you can find ANY percentage! (see the percentage section below)

**Real-life use:** Quick tip calculations, sale discounts, understanding tax amounts!

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ ADDITION TRICKS

### ‚ú® Round Up and Fix It

**The idea:** Round numbers to make them easier, then fix your answer.

**Why this works:** It's easier to add 80 + 30 than 73 + 28. Our brain likes round numbers!

**Example: 73 + 28** *(Let's go slow)*

**Step 1:** Round to easy numbers
- 73 ‚Üí round up to 80 (you added 7 extra)
- 28 ‚Üí round up to 30 (you added 2 extra)
- *Write this down: added 7 and added 2*

**Step 2:** Add the easy numbers
- 80 + 30 = 110 *(much easier!)*

**Step 3:** Fix it (take away the extras)
- You added 7 + 2 = 9 too much
- Take it back: 110 - 9 = **101** ‚úì

**Think of it like this:** You borrowed 9 extra dollars, now pay it back!

**More examples:**

**Example: 164 + 279**

- Round: 170 + 280 = 450
- Fix: You added 6 + 1 = 7
- Answer: 450 - 7 = **443**

**Example: 52 + 399**

- Round: 50 + 400 = 450
- Fix: You rounded 52 DOWN by 2 and 399 UP by 1
- So: 450 - 1 + 2 = **451** (or easier: 52 + 400 - 1 = 451)

---

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ SUBTRACTION TRICKS

### ‚ú® Round Up and Fix (for Subtraction)

**The idea:** Round the SECOND number up, subtract, then add back what you rounded.

**Example: 382 - 149**

**Step 1:** Round the second number up

- 149 ‚Üí round to 150 (you added 1)

**Step 2:** Subtract the easy number

- 382 - 150 = 232

**Step 3:** Add back what you rounded

- 232 + 1 = **233**

**Why this works:** When we rounded 149 to 150, we subtracted TOO MUCH. So we need to add a little back.

**More examples:**

- 560 - 237 ‚Üí 560 - 240 = 320, then 320 + 3 = **323**
- 1000 - 68 ‚Üí 1000 - 70 = 930, then 930 + 2 = **932**

---

### ‚ú® The "9-9-10" Rule (Subtracting from 1000)

**The magic rule:** To subtract any 3-digit number from 1000, use this pattern:

- **First digit:** 9 minus that digit
- **Second digit:** 9 minus that digit
- **Last digit:** 10 minus that digit

**Example: 1000 - 274**

1. First digit (2): 9 - 2 = **7**
2. Second digit (7): 9 - 7 = **2**
3. Last digit (4): 10 - 4 = **6**
4. Put together: **726**

**More examples:**

- 1000 - 639 ‚Üí (9-6)(9-3)(10-9) = **361**
- 1000 - 845 ‚Üí (9-8)(9-4)(10-5) = **155**
- 1000 - 123 ‚Üí (9-1)(9-2)(10-3) = **877**

**Memory trick:** "Nine, nine, ten‚Äînow you win!"

---

### ‚ú® Subtracting from 100

**The pattern:** To subtract any 2-digit number from 100:

- **Tens digit:** 9 minus that digit
- **Ones digit:** 10 minus that digit

**Example: 100 - 68**

1. Tens (6): 9 - 6 = **3**
2. Ones (8): 10 - 8 = **2**
3. Answer: **32**

**More examples:**

- 100 - 54 ‚Üí (9-5)(10-4) = **46**
- 100 - 87 ‚Üí (9-8)(10-7) = **13**
- 100 - 23 ‚Üí (9-2)(10-3) = **77**

---

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ MULTIPLICATION TRICKS

### ‚ú® Multiplying by 5

**The trick:** Multiply by 10 (easy!), then cut it in half.

**Why this works:** 5 is exactly half of 10, so we multiply by 10 (just add a zero) then take half.

**Example: 63 √ó 5** *(Step by step)*

**Step 1:** Multiply by 10 *(you already know this!)*
- 63 √ó 10 = 630 (just add a zero)

**Step 2:** Cut in half *(divide by 2)*
- 630 √∑ 2 = **315**
- *Hint: 600 √∑ 2 = 300, and 30 √∑ 2 = 15, so 300 + 15 = 315*

**More examples with clear steps:**

**Example: 84 √ó 5**
- Step 1: 84 √ó 10 = 840
- Step 2: 840 √∑ 2 = **420** *(80 √∑ 2 = 40, so 840 √∑ 2 = 420)*

**Example: 46 √ó 5**
- Step 1: 46 √ó 10 = 460
- Step 2: 460 √∑ 2 = **230** *(easy: half of 460)*

**üí™ Try these yourself:**
- 22 √ó 5 = ? *(Answer: 220 √∑ 2 = 110)*
- 38 √ó 5 = ? *(Answer: 380 √∑ 2 = 190)*

**Real-life use:** Money calculations (5 dollar bills, 5 cents each, etc.)!

---

### ‚ú® Multiplying by 9

**The trick:** Multiply by 10, then subtract the original number.

**Example: 57 √ó 9**

1. Multiply by 10: 57 √ó 10 = 570
2. Subtract original: 570 - 57 = **513**

**Need help subtracting?**

- 570 - 57
- Think: 570 - 50 = 520
- Then: 520 - 7 = **513**

**More examples:**

- 34 √ó 9 ‚Üí 340 - 34 = **306**
- 25 √ó 9 ‚Üí 250 - 25 = **225**
- 123 √ó 9 ‚Üí 1230 - 123 = **1107**

**Why this works:** 9 is one less than 10, so we multiply by 10 then take away one copy of the number.

---

### ‚ú® Multiplying by 11 (Two-Digit Numbers)

**The magic pattern:**

1. Write the FIRST digit
2. Add the two digits together
3. Write the LAST digit

**Example: 27 √ó 11**

1. First digit: **2**
2. Add them: 2 + 7 = **9**
3. Last digit: **7**
4. Answer: **297**

**Example with carrying: 64 √ó 11**

1. First digit: **6**
2. Add them: 6 + 4 = **10** (This is two digits!)
3. Last digit: **4**
4. Since the middle is 10, write 0 and carry the 1
5. Add the carry to the first digit: 6 + 1 = 7
6. Answer: **704**

**More examples:**

- 53 √ó 11 ‚Üí 5, (5+3=8), 3 = **583**
- 72 √ó 11 ‚Üí 7, (7+2=9), 2 = **792**
- 85 √ó 11 ‚Üí 8, (8+5=13), 5 ‚Üí **935** (with carry)

### ‚ú® Squaring Numbers Ending in 5 (AMAZING MAGIC!)

**This is the most impressive trick!** Perfect for showing off or checking calculator answers.

**The magic rule:** Any number ending in 5, when squared, follows this pattern:

1. Ignore the 5 for now‚Äîlook at the digit(s) before it (call this N)
2. Multiply N √ó (N+1) *(that means N times the next number)*
3. Write down your answer from step 2
4. Stick "25" at the end
5. Done!

**Example: 65¬≤** (That's 65 √ó 65) - **Super detailed walkthrough:**

**Step 1:** What's before the 5? It's **6**

**Step 2:** What's the next number after 6? It's **7**

**Step 3:** Multiply them: 6 √ó 7 = **42**

**Step 4:** Write 42, then stick 25 on the end: **4225**

**That's it!** 65 √ó 65 = 4225 ‚úì

**Let's do another one slowly: 35¬≤**

- Step 1: What's before the 5? ‚Üí **3**
- Step 2: What's 3 + 1? ‚Üí **4**
- Step 3: Multiply 3 √ó 4 = **12**
- Step 4: Write 12, add 25 at the end ‚Üí **1225** ‚úì

**More examples:**

- 25¬≤ ‚Üí 2 √ó 3 = 6 ‚Üí **625**
- 45¬≤ ‚Üí 4 √ó 5 = 20 ‚Üí **2025**
- 75¬≤ ‚Üí 7 √ó 8 = 56 ‚Üí **5625**
- 85¬≤ ‚Üí 8 √ó 9 = 72 ‚Üí **7225**
- 95¬≤ ‚Üí 9 √ó 10 = 90 ‚Üí **9025**
- 15¬≤ ‚Üí 1 √ó 2 = 2 ‚Üí **225**

**üí™ Try these yourself:**
- 55¬≤ = ? *(Answer: 5 √ó 6 = 30, so 3025)*
- 105¬≤ = ? *(Answer: 10 √ó 11 = 110, so 11025)*

**This is pure magic!** It ALWAYS works for numbers ending in 5. No exceptions!

**Real-life use:** Impress your friends, quickly calculate areas (like 15 feet √ó 15 feet), or double-check calculator answers!
